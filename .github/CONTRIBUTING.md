## General guidelines

### Developing
- Use appropriate coding styles and adhere to the naming conventions adopted in the repository. For this repository, we are mainly using `snake_case` as our naming convention.
- Compile and test code locally first before submitting any PRs.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check any coding style issues before committing your codes. You can check the installation guide for `pre-commit` [here](https://pre-commit.com)
